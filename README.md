# Welcome to the CUSP London Data Dive 2024

The CUSP London data dive brings together global student teams to address urban data challenges. This year we will consider relationships between urban data variables in the domains of:

- Transport
- Safety
- Air Quality
- Health

In cities such as:

- London
- Newcastle
- New York

How can we quantify urban data relationships and what insights can be obtained to make our cities accessible, healthier and more liveable?
